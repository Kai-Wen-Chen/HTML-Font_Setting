Font setting

< H1 >< /H1 >: This tag can set the font size of headings, H1 is the largest while H6 is the smallest

< font face="xxx" size="N" color="ffffff" >< /font >: This tag can declare the font face, size and color of characters

xxx should replaced with the name of font face, ex: Arial

if you need a chinese font face, you have to put < meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=big5" > at the top of the html file, then you can change the font face of chinese characters, ex: 細明體

N indicates a number between 1 and 7

ffffff are six hexadecimal numbers because all colors consist of red, green and blue, and the leftest two numbers control the amount of red, the middle two numbers manage green, last two numbers are in charge of blue

Therefore, ff0000 means red, 00ff00 means green, 0000ff means blue

< i >< /i > make the font italic, < b > means bold, and < u > means underline
